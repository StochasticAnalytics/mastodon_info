1 - be a good human - if you think that is too vague, then slide on by

2 - Be okay with being wrong and leave space for others to have the same boldness. Build each other up, and don't be afraid to be taken down a peg!

3 - we encourage you to be you. We also encourage (but don't require) the use of content wrappers (CWs) to tag posts that arenâ€™t targeted at the entire community to allow others to curate their feeds. CW has a subject line and blurs the rest by default. This does not seem to limit engagement!

4 - Job postings - must - have the hashtag #jobs. We encourage and boost job opportunities but also appreciate a mechanism for those who aren't on the market to filter such posts.
