## Overview:

This repo serves three main purposes:

1 - A source to share, collaborate, and discuss community related issues. E.g.

  - the server privacy policy
  - rules and moderation guidelines

2 - A source of record to log important information. E.g.

  - planned updates/downtime
  - banned instances and the logic behind each decision
    
3 - A repository for scripts and useful information for using and mainting the server. E.g.

  - Tips for app interface setup
  - Advice on cross-posting etc.
  - More admin related information like back policy etc.

## Welcome note:

Here is some info to help get you started!

Please note that I am currently setting up a new server that will be more inclusive of related techniques, like MX, NMR, and computational methods, for example. You will be asked to migrate to this server ( cryoem.social -> struct.bio ) sometime in the next month or so. 

You'll also get a list of suggested accounts to follow when you first log in, which is hopefully helpful.


The "official" iOS app leaves plenty to be desired. I've really enjoyed MetaText, which has the most native Twitter like feel. The maintainer of that open source project is stepping back for a bit, so TOOT which cost a couple dollars may be a better long term bet. 

If you are using a web browser, click on your settings and enable the **"advanced web view."**
This will allow you to have multiple columns, including "pinning" a hashtag (see screenshot below.
Tools to find twitter following/followers who put their mastodon handle in their bio (you should do this!)

## Mastodon basics:

So far, it feels a lot like the good parts of Twitter, and there are a ton of articles on migrating. A few key notes:

- If you want to migrate to another server, that is a-okay and just requires a few steps. Your network and content will follow you.

- If you decide to change your handle, you create a new account and then migrate to that. The one snag is that your old handle still exists and may appear in places acting as a redirect. This could be problematic for deadnames etc.

- By default, you will just see content that is happening on the cryoEM server (or federation.) If you enable the "advanced web view" in settings, you can have multiple columns (feeds) where you see local and "federated" views similar to twitter
You will also see federated content from other users on our server; as it grows, everyone's experience will improve! I've started by following a few folks from a handful of different servers to cross-pollinate.
You might think of it as regular Twitter (as the local network expands) with a nice optional "mini-twitter" that is just focused on what people in the local federation post (original content, not boosts [RTs] etc.

That's about it. I'm figuring this out just like you, so if you have questions or figure out anything cool please @ me!


## Tips for migrating

- Follow people liberally and then unfollow if their content is not serving you.
- You can personally block or mute accounts or servers. One thing I have enjoyed is muting accounts for a week, available in the dropdown upon muting, and giving them a second chance.
- ***Cross post!***
  - While there are plenty on mastodon who moan about cross-posting, I think it is a great way to seed our timeline, and encourage the move. If you are still posting on Twitter, I strongly encourage you to use [MOA](https://moa.party/)
  - I suggest only posting from Twitter -> Mastodon (to encourage the move) and have elected to cross-post by default, but you may select an opt in. Both controlled by a simple hashtag.

        [X] Crossposting Enabled?

        Conditional crossposting:
            Disabled
            Crosspost only if hashtag #moa or #xp is present
        [X] Crosspost unless hashtag #nomoa or #noxp is present

    I did not select any thing to enable Mastodon -> Twitter:

        Post Public toots to Twitter?
        Post Private toots to Twitter?
        Post Unlisted toots to Twitter?
        Post Boosts to Twitter?
        Split long toots on Twitter?
        Link toot with warning if there are sensitive images?
        Remove toot content warning?

    
        [X] Post tweets to Mastodon?
        Toot visibility:
            [X] Public
            Private
            Unlisted
        Post RTs to Mastodon?
        Post quoted tweets to Mastodon?
        NOTE: Retweets are always posted as 'Unlisted'.
        Always Post Tweets behind a Content Warning?
        NOTE: Tweets containing "CW: phrase" will have a Content Warning when converted to a toot.
