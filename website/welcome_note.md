# Welcome to StructBio! 

## Instance goals

This instance is built to be a home for those with an interest in how the wigglings and jigglings of biological molecules make life happen.

Many of us are practicing scientists; however, all are welcome. We hope to have a high density of science-related posts while also being a forum for people just to be - people.

## Your input is wanted!

We are a community governed instance. Please visit the [instance GitHub](https://github.com/StochasticAnalytics/mastodon_struct_bio_info) to make suggestions or changes to things like:

- instance privacy policy
- server rules
- This welcome note!
